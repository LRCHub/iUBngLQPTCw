# DEEMO – THE SPIRIT OF THE NIGHT(FULL MIX VERSION )

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Ride on a gale of wind
Chasing a shooting star
Pull off some miracles
Tonight I'll be the hero

I feel the power of the magic
Flowing into my soul
Let the night burn away come on get ready, set go!

I got the spirit of the night
Getting furious and serious
I got the spirit of the night
Nothing can stop me

I got the spirit of the night
Feeling alive and kicking
I got the spirit of the night
Running to the light
Nothing can stop me

Looking at the blazing moon
Just like a fireball
I swear by it, baby
Never will break your heart

I feel the power of the magic
Flowing into my soul
Let the night burn away come on get ready, set go!

I got the spirit of the night
Getting furious and serious
I got the spirit of the night
Nothing can stop me

I got the spirit of the night
Feeling alive and kicking
I got the spirit of the night
Running to the light
Nothing can stop me
